## Advanced Enhancements & Future Work (Checklist Items)
This project has addressed many items from the initial improvement checklist. However, some items are ongoing processes or represent more significant future enhancements:

*   **üöÄ Melhorar com Mais Dados (Improve with More Data):**
    *   **Puxar mais dados hist√≥ricos de jogos, odds, estat√≠sticas dos jogadores, confrontos diretos, clima, etc.:** Continuously collecting and integrating more comprehensive historical data is crucial for model improvement. This includes setting up automated data pipelines and potentially exploring new data sources beyond match results and basic form.
    *   **Integrar m√∫ltiplas APIs (ex.: The Odds API, API-Football, SportMonks, etc.):** While API-Football and a placeholder for SportMonks are in `data_collection.py`, fully integrating more APIs like "The Odds API" and completing the SportMonks integration requires further development.

*   **üß† Melhorar o Treinamento (Improve Training):**
    *   **Testar outros modelos (Redes neurais se for deep learning):** The system currently supports Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Exploring more complex models like Neural Networks (Deep Learning) or other gradient boosting machines (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost) could yield performance gains but requires significant research and implementation effort.

*   **üèÅ Avalia√ß√£o Real (Real Evaluation):**
    *   **Simular apostas com base nas previs√µes para ver retorno real (backtest):** Implementing a robust backtesting framework to simulate betting strategies based on model predictions would provide a more realistic measure of the model's practical utility and financial return. This is a substantial undertaking.

*   **Data Quality and Pipeline Robustness:**
    *   Ongoing efforts will be needed to ensure data quality, handle API changes, and make the entire data collection, preprocessing, training, and prediction pipeline more robust and automated.
