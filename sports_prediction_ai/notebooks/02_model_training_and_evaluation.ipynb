However, improvements in metrics on a validation set after tuning (e.g., more trees, different depth) indirectly indicate learning. If using XGBoost with `verbose=True` (or a callback) during training with an `eval_set`, you'd monitor the printed validation loss (e.g., `validation_0-mlogloss`).\n",
